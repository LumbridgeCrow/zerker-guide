# :osrs-home: Welcome to Zerker
This website is meant to help you keep fast track a new account to become a zerker, but also show you the route to make the perfect completionist account. Navigate with the directory to the left and you'll find all the information you need!

<span class="hl-color">There are quite a few different build paths you can go:</span>   
- If you are primarily a pker, 60 attack is extremely versatile and fun. If you want to stay low combat, 50 attack is a good option as well, but not as versatile imo.    
- If you prefer to do pvm content often, 80/82 attack is highly recommended, and will still give you room to pk, although you will most likely fight piety builds.  
- 85 Prayer + is only for completionists that want the desert elite diaries completed. If you go 85 prayer while staying 82 attack, this will land you at a clean 105 combat.

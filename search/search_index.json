Navigate with the directory to the left and you'll find all the information you need!</p> <p>There are quite a few different build paths you can go:  - If you are primarily a pker, 60 attack is extremely versatile and fun. If you want to stay low combat, 50 attack is a good option as well, but not as versatile imo.   - If you prefer to do pvm content often, 80/82 attack is highly recommended, and will still give you room to pk, although you will most likely fight piety builds. - 85 Prayer + is only for completionists that want the desert elite diaries completed. If you go 85 prayer while staying 82 attack, this will land you at a clean 105 combat. - Calculate your combat here</p>"},{"location":"#credits","title":"Credits","text":"<p>Big inspiration and thanks to TheLope for creating such an awesome Clue Tag website.
